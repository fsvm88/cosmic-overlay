		The cosmic-utils category contains community-developed applications,
		applets, and utilities for the COSMIC desktop environment. These packages
		are maintained by the cosmic-utils organization on GitHub and provide
		additional functionality beyond the core COSMIC desktop components.

		This includes full-featured applications (calculators, text editors,
		task managers, weather apps), panel/dock applets (system monitors,
		quick actions), and command-line utilities for COSMIC integration.
